## [Google Team Drive Theme Template](https://github.com/isolary/iso-tools/tree/master/google-team-drive-template)

We’re pretty obsessive (in a good way) about file management. So we created this little template to spruce up our team drives. This template will create a header image and is sized to automagically create a nice folder icon.

Nothing fancy. It’ll probably be replaced by a native feature here soon. Until then, it’s yours to keep and use however you please. Don’t be a dingus and go out reselling or doing other evils with it.
