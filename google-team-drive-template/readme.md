We’re pretty obsessive (in a good way) about file management. So we created this little template to spruce up our team drives. This template will create a header image and is sized to automagically create a nice folder icon.

Nothing fancy. It’ll probably be replaced by a native feature here soon. Until then, it’s yours to keep and use however you please. Don’t be a dingus and go out reselling or doing other evils with it.

1. Download/add to drive
2. Edit/Export
3. Add it as a custom theme (Change Theme > Create Custom Theme)
4. Chill out
